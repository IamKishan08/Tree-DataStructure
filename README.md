   #  Tree - Data Structure

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and references to its child nodes. The topmost node is called the **root**, and the nodes without children are called **leaf nodes**.

## Key Concepts in Tree Data Structure

 - **Root Node:** The topmost node of a tree.

 - **Parent Node:** A node that has one or more child nodes.

  - **Child Node:** A node that descends from a parent node.

 - **Leaf Node:** A node with no children.

 - **Height:** The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

 - **Depth:** The length of the path from the root to a given node.
